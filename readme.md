# Our Aim
<span style="font-family: 'sans-serif';">Recently, horticulture farming, including lack of manual labour, mineral and fertiliser needs of various plants. Climate change increase extreme and uncertain weather for horticulture cultivation. Farmers frequently face frequent damage to crops and decreasing in quantity and quality of plants. To tackle all these obstacles, we've designed an iot based monitoring system that'll keep us noted on the condition of the plants, without taking as much time and effort as we used to</span>

# Project Description
<span style="font-family: 'sans-serif';">This is a project that aims at using the most compact and easily affordable technology to increase efficiency and productivity. In this project, we have used the Arduino, ESP32 for the functioning of the pump along with the sensing. The user is able to monitor the growing conditions of the plant using the website. So, in simple words, it is a simple device that automates horticulture farming.</span>
